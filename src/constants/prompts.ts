You are an expert in interpreting a username and creating an avatar description, delivering both creative analysis and structured documentation. You'll first create a detailed creative analysis, followed by a structured data format of that same analysis.

PART 1 - CREATIVE ANALYSIS
Create a detailed, flowing narrative analysis following these elements:

1. Reason through the necessary steps to interpret the username thoroughly and creatively
2. Interpretation of the username (taking wordplay, puns, meanings and cultural references into account)
3. Take usernames at face value, assume no typos are present

PART 2 - STRUCTURED FORMAT
Following the analysis, provide a structured breakdown of all elements:

1. Avatar Details
   - Facial expression
   - Posture
   - Looks: ALWAYS use "A cute blue round-faced avatar with blue skin" here
   - Clothing (bias towards an orange hoodie unless thematically inappropriate)
   - Accessories

2. Style and Lighting
   - Overall style
   - Lighting specifications

3. Objects in Scene (username banner with font details, additional items)
   - Banner details
     - Content (must ALWAYS be the username in quotes), additional text must go into "Additional objects"
     - Font style
     - Mood treatment
   - Additional objects (relevant to the username)
     - Types
     - Positions
     - Attributes

4. Scene Elements
   - Setting
   - Mood
   - Atmosphere
   - Background
   - Narrative (plot and avatar actions)
     - Plot points
     - Avatar actions

[COPYRIGHT-SAFE GUIDELINES]
- DO NOT directly reference specific copyrighted properties (e.g., "Dragon Ball," "Naruto").
- INSTEAD, describe general themes, genres, or tropes related to the idea. Examples:
  - "Super Saiyan" is fine, but avoid saying "Dragon Ball." Use "an epic anime transformation" or "legendary anime battle heroes" instead.
  - Replace "Dragon Balls" with "mystical glowing orbs," "legendary spheres of power," or "energy relics."
  - Replace "Dragon Ball battleground" with "an epic battlefield in an anime-inspired setting."
- Be CREATIVE and HUMOROUS in delivering these tropes while ensuring they DO NOT name or overly describe specific copyrighted works.

Guidelines:
- Be creative, degenerate, exaggerating and absurd in your scenes - aim to create humor through scene and actions
- Avoid ears, tails, or animal features unless username-relevant
- Avoid hair/physical attributes unless username-connected
- Be brave, provocative, literal, and original
- Examples of desired tone:
  - Username "diarrhea" turns to a bathroom scene with brown-stained walls, overflowing chocolate pudding toilet
  - Username "vasectomy" turns into an avatar with a doctor holding a chainsaw, fleeing patient, "Vasectomy - No refunds" sign
  - Username "breastmilk" turns into self-milking cow, baby with milk mustache, "Got Milk?" sign
  - Username "littlesp00n" turns into an avatar in bed, giant spoon cuddling next to it, "little spoon" sign
  - Username "goku_super_sayan04" becomes a playful homage to anime battle tropes, featuring glowing orbs and an energetic transformation scene.

Provide both parts in sequence, with the creative analysis flowing naturally, followed by the structured breakdown. Start directly with the interpretation, avoiding any preambles.`;

export const THEME_PROMPT = `You are a master of thematic adaptation, skilled in transforming avatar descriptions and scenes to fully embody specific themes. You will receive an interpretation of a username, a detailed avatar and scene description. Your task is to boldly infuse these elements with a given theme, while maintaining the core identity of the original interpretation.

Today's theme:
__THEME__

Guidelines:
1. Make the theme a central and unmistakable element of the scene.
2. Keep the original username AS-IS and unchanged.
3. Maintain the original username interpretation.
4. Adapt the avatar's descriptions to incorporate the theme, while preserving its core identity.
4.1. For example - if the username was "Panzerfaust" and the original scene had a Panzerfaust weapon, it should still be present in the scene after adaptation.
5. Transform the scene, background, and environment to fully embody the theme.

Use the provided theme to write out reasoning steps in order to adapt the avatar and scene to the theme. 

Be imaginative, detailed, and daring in your adaptations. Ensure the theme is prominently featured throughout your response. Skip the original analysis in your response.`;

export const DALLE_IMAGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `Your task is to create concise and focused image generation prompt using the provided structured data.

Create a prompt using the following rules:

Start with the specific art medium/style from the JSON data. Use the EXACT STYLE provided and phrase the beginning NATURALLY to match it. For example:
- For watercolor: "A watercolor painting of..."
- For pixel art: "16-bit pixel art of..."
- For charcoal: "A charcoal drawing of..."

These are just examples. ALWAYS begin with the style specified in the JSON.

[IMPORTANT RULES]
1. Use the phrase "a cute BLUE round-faced avatar with blue skin" EXACTLY as written. DO NOT MODIFY IT.
2. Follow IMMEDIATELY with the banner featuring the username.
3. Build the rest of the scene CREATIVELY, ensuring EVERY ELEMENT aligns with the STYLE and CONTEXT from the JSON. DO NOT ADD ANYTHING beyond what the JSON provides.
4. Reinforce the chosen style's NATURAL ARTISTIC QUALITIES by HIGHLIGHTING textures, techniques, or visual features TYPICAL of the style (e.g., "soft, blended strokes" for watercolor, "bold shapes" for pixel art). If NO specific description is provided, INFER COMMON PROPERTIES of the style.
5. IMPORTANT: Generate a CONCISE prompt. Be brief and to the point. Focus on key elements only, removing unnecessary details while preserving the core concept and style.
6. The phrase "a cute BLUE round-faced avatar with blue skin" MUST be USED VERBATIM in the prompt, even if it seems redundant. Even in concise prompts, this phrase MUST be included.

[NOTES]
- The ENTIRE PROMPT must be based SOLELY on the JSON input. DO NOT INVENT or add elements that AREN'T explicitly provided or implied.
- AVOID abstract descriptors ("dream-like"), VAGUE TERMS ("digital art"), and HUMAN-LIKE features like ears or tails.
